# Project Euler #1
## Find the sum of the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 (natural numbers only)

This can be easily solved using a loop of some sort, but that will get slow once we increase the range.
I was curious as to how I could solve this more efficiently, and after a couple of hours, I discovered the **Finite Sum of Arithmetic Series** formula.
